# lunaro
a launcher for apps(only works on linux) that had logging root igpu(intergrated gpu) and dgpu(dedicated gpu) forcing.

use the command "help" for variables and commands
config file, log file folder, appimage directory are located in /home/"user"/

yes i will still be updating it its not a 1 time project it may take long to update because im a 12 year old doing this

requirements: linux
reccomended: remove passwords for sudo because -r may not work
btw put all your appimages you want lunaro to access in /home/"user"/pwogams

hope you enjoy! also maybe it has an easter egg maybe it doesnt. who knows? well me but still.
